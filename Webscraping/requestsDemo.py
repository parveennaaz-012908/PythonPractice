        you must open the file in write binary mode by passing the string 'wb' as the second argument to open().

        you need to write binary data instead of text data in order to maintain the Unicode encoding of the text.

        The iter_content() method returns  "chunks" of the content on each iteration through loop
        Each chunk  is the bytes data type, you get to specify how bytes each chunk will contain
